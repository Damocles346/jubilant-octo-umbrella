bootstrap dropdown select

speeds will need to be picked later (i think)

Types of immunities for the immunity special ability

special abilities make the one that affect stats actually affect stats

text attribute in grafts

spells don't always use high attack bonus. use which one is selected

add the rest of the grafts

let soldier type choose main attack type

TODOs

add basic stat block maybe only choosing step 1 options

Languages dropdown

dropdowns for speeds

attackMod value in adjustments

if perception is a master skill add the master value to the stat block

reach

alignment - add to statblock and choose in final step, also size

other abilities

fly shouldnt be a free ability

add labels to drops

make sure free graft and special abilities apply in the correct place

handle lashunta spells

fix special ability aura, and ones with commas

check special abilities for ability score adjustments

turn finish button into reset button

make the ranged spell attack value next to CL refect which choice was made on the attack card. make sure main attack type is validated if spels are used

add in a multi dropdown to create user fillable stat block sections. Gear. tactics, ecology

To Test
soldier class melee/ranged - to test
envoy skillchoice - to test
Spellcasting needs to regenerate when creature array changed


Test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mjcadz/sfrpgtools.git

Nice To Have
show ability scores next to skills

hide desription areas while changing text then show. will avoid loading looks

add menu header bootstrap-select, so show what the user should be doing

Change handling of previously set ability scores so that it is read from the creature entry ( will allow for easier creature type additions)

Bug where if Construct selected, subtype must be magical or technological. Then applying graft that changed the sub type. Doesn't work properly and shouldn't work

check oozes only natural skills,

doesn't quite work unless cleared properly: change html save bits to use official  window storage saves

if possible make print style sheet work with values on the same line
