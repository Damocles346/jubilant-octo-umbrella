speeds will need to be picked later (i think)

Types of immunities for the immunity special ability

special abilities make the one that affect stats actually affect stats

text attribute in grafts

let creature abilities turn on spell-like abilities

change html save bits to use official  window storage saves

make the height of the wizard to height of the heightiest tab.

Change the data gathering to iterate through entries and objects instead of setting outright, that way nothing will be missed

check oozes only natural skills,

find out how low.high attack values work

change the bootstarp dropdown focus color to something else. mint?

add the rest of the grafts

add basic stat block maybe only choosing step 1 options

make ability mods be in the correct order

Languages dropdown

dropdowns for speeds

reach

alignment - add to statblock and choose in final step, also size

other abilities

handle lashunta spells

fix special ability aura, and ones with commas

spellcasting type in stat block, Spells Known. (mystic technomancer also.) or spell-like abilities

To Test
soldier class melee/ranged - to test
envoy skillchoice - to test
Spellcasting needs to regenerate when creature array changed


Test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mjcadz/sfrpgtools.git

Nice To Have
show ability scores next to skills

hide desription areas while changing text then show. will avoid loading looks

add menu header bootstrap-select, so show what the user should be doing

Change handling of previously set ability scores so that it is read from the creature entry ( will allow for easier creature type additions)

Bug where if Construct selected, subtype must be magical or technological. Then applying graft that changed the sub type. Doesn't work properly and shouldn't work
