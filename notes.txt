Change the data gathering to iterate through entries and objects instead of setting outright, that way nothing will be missed

make sure perception is in the correct skill group when data gathering

check oozes only natural skills,

find out how low.high attack values work

final check for save boost special ability.

check special abilities for ability score adjustments

Nice To Have
hide desription areas while changing text then show. will avoid loading looks

add menu header bootstrap-select, so show what the user should be doing

Change handling of previously set ability scores so that it is read from the creature entry ( will allow for easier creature type additions)
