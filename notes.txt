bootstrap dropdown select

speeds will need to be picked later (i think)

Types of immunities for the immunity special ability

text attribute in grafts

add the rest of the grafts

weaknesses, maybe make new section instead of being part of free abilities. add dropdowns for vulnerabilities and depenencies and move general weaknesses to here

"AttackChanges" "DamageMod"

add dropdown for resistance and immunities (or prompyt user to add to statblock)

humanoids and outsider set size to medium or small. only make giant available to these creatures

TODOs

add basic stat block maybe only choosing step 1 options

dropdowns for speeds

phrenic adjustments

make giant and miniature affect size StartToStart

make sure free graft and special abilities apply in the correct place

handle lashunta spells

turn finish button into reset button

make the ranged spell attack value next to CL refect which choice was made on the attack card. make sure main attack type is validated if spels are used

To Test
soldier class melee/ranged - to test
envoy skillchoice - to test
Spellcasting needs to regenerate when creature array changed


Test
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mjcadz/sfrpgtools.git

Nice To Have

make the display of creature traits optional eg, showing the traits

display available immunities

show ability scores next to skills in dropdown

special abilities make the one that affect stats actually affect stats

hide desription areas while changing text then show. will avoid loading looks

add menu header bootstrap-select, so show what the user should be doing

Change handling of previously set ability scores so that it is read from the creature entry ( will allow for easier creature type additions)

Bug where if Construct selected, subtype must be magical or technological. Then applying graft that changed the sub type. Doesn't work properly and shouldn't work

check oozes only natural skills,

doesn't quite work unless cleared properly: change html save bits to use official  window storage saves

if possible make print style sheet work with values on the same line
