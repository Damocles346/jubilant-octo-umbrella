Nice To Have

handle "IfDRExists"

add the rest of the grafts

add basic stat block maybe only choosing step 1 options

sort the free abilities into speeds senses etc

make the display of creature traits optional eg, showing the traits

display available immunities

show ability scores next to skills in dropdown

special abilities make the one that affect stats actually affect stats

hide desription areas while changing text then show. will avoid loading looks (don't think times a bad enough for this yet)

Change handling of previously set ability scores so that it is read from the creature entry ( will allow for easier creature type additions)

Bug where if Construct selected, subtype must be magical or technological. Then applying graft that changed the sub type. Doesn't work properly and shouldn't work

check oozes only natural skills,

if possible make print style sheet work with values on the same line

text attribute in grafts

add DCs to racial spell like abilities
